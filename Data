generated at random according to a fixed set of rules

Composition There are 11^16 × 6^16 = 129, 629, 238, 163, 050, 258, 624, 287, 932, 416 possible compositions, some of which are
more likely than others. Since this is a huge number of different possibilities, each time you play the game you are likely
to compose a piece of music that has never been heard before! Mozart carefully constructed the measures to obey a rigid
harmonic structure, so each waltz reflects Mozart’s distinct style. Unfortunately, due to the rigidity, the process never results
in anything truly extraordinary.
